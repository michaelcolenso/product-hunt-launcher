Agent 3 — Teardown Writer
Input: outputs/scorecard.md (for Section 6 reference), outputs/playbook_v3.1.md (for asset checklist reference)
Output: outputs/teardown.md
Run when: Agents 1 and 2 are complete
Task
Write a complete, annotated Product Hunt launch teardown. Minimum 2,500 words. This is the premium content that justifies the price point — the asset that gets shared in Slack channels and bookmarked for years.
This is not a success story. It is a documented decision log with honest commentary about what worked, what almost failed, and what would have been done differently.
Composite Disclosure
Open the document with this block, filled in honestly:
markdown> **A note on this teardown**: This case study is built from documented patterns across [X] lection: How many hunters were approached, response rate, the actual outreach message that received a yes (paraphrased if composite), and what made that hunter the right choice.
Section 3 — The 24-Hour Launch Log (800–1,000 words)
Format each entry as:
markdown**[TIME] PST**
*Ranking: #[X] | Upvotes: [N] | Comments: [N]*

[2–4 sentences of narrative: what was happening, what action was taken, why]
Required checkpoints: 12:01 AM, 1:00 AM, 6:00 AM, 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM, 6:00 PM, 9:00 PM, 11:59 PM
Between checkpoints, include:

The moment of highest anxiety and what was done
The moment it became clear Top 5 was achievable
Which community drove the most unexpected traffic
The comment that required the most thoughtful response and what was written

Section ation of a real process.
Every metric must be a plausible range, not an implausible fantasy. A composite Top 5 launch for a solo founder with 800 email subscribers looks different from one with 5,000.
Do not reference specific real products, founders, or companies without explicit permissionwn with no failures is not credible and the reader will know it.
What Would Change: If launching the same product again tomorrow, what are the top 3 changes? These must be specific and actionable, not "I would have built more audience."
Section 6 — Scorecard Retrospective (200–300 words)
Run this launch through the Scorecard from Agent 1. Use the exact category names. Show what score this founder would have received pre-launch, which categories were strong, which were weak despite the Top 5 outcome, and what the Scorecard would have told them to fix that they didn't fix. This section validates the Scorecard as a predictive tool.
Constraints

Write entirely in first person from the founder's perspective
No humble-brag framing. No failure porn. Honest document4 — The Numbers (300–400 words)
Present this table then interpret every row:
markdown| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Final Ranking | |
| Total Upvotes | |
| Total Comments | |
| Comment-to-Upvote Ratio | |
| Unique Visitors (24hr) | |
| Email Signups (24hr) | |
| Visitor-to-Signup Rate | |
| Free Trial Activations | |
| Paid Conversions (7-day) | |
| MRR Added (30-day) | |
After the table: interpret what these numbers meant relative to the launch goal. Was it a success by the founder's own definition? What surprised them?
Section 5 — Post-Mortem (400–500 words)
Three subsections:
What Worked Better Than Expected: 2–3 specific things with the actual result vs. expectation.
What Almost Killed the Launch: 1–2 honest failures or near-failures. A teardoTop 5 Product Hunt launches. The product, founder details, and timeline are composite. Every decision point, metric range, and outcome reflects real launch data — nothing here is invented. We've chosen this format to protect founder privacy while giving you the most instructive version of the story.
If you have access to a real launch with permission to document it, replace this block with founder attribution and remove the composite framing entirely.
Required Sections
Section 1 — The Setup (400–500 words)
Establish the product, founder situation, and stakes as narrative prose. Include as embedded details (not a bullet list):

What the product does in one sentence
Audience size entering launch: email list count, Twitter followers, Ship followers
The stated launch goal
The single biggest risk identified pre-launch
The launch date, day of week, and the reasoning behind that choice

End this section with the sentence: "Here is exactly what happened."
Section 2 — The Asset Decisions (600–800 words)
For each asset, document the decision process:
Tagline: Show 3 iterations with rejection reasoning for each. Annotate the final version against the Asset Quality criteria from the Scorecard (Agent 1 output).
Thumbnail: Describe design choices, what was animated, contrast decisions, what was rejected and why.
Gallery Image 1: What it showed, why that specific visual was chosen over 2 alternatives considered.
Maker Comment: Show a before draft and final version. Annotate what changed and why each change was made.
