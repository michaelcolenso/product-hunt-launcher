Agent 4 — Product Packager
Input: All three outputs from Agents 1–3
Output: outputs/bundle_structure.md, outputs/landing_page_brief.md, outputs/gumroad_setup.md, outputs/start_here.md, outputs/quick_reference_card.md
Run when: Agents 1, 2, and 3 are all complete
Task A — Start Here Document
Write outputs/start_here.md (400–500 words). This is the first thing the customer reads after purchase. It must:

Confirm they made the right purchase decision without being sycophantic
Explain the three components and their relationship to each other in plain language
Give a clear usage sequence: Scorecard first → Teardown second → Playbook as reference
Set honest expectations: what this product will and won't do for them
End with one sentence that gets them to opeything or just the parts relevant to my score?"

Each answer: 50–80 words. Direct. Acknowledge the real concern behind the question before answering it.
Task D — Gumroad Setup
Write outputs/gumroad_setup.md with exact configuration:

Product name (exact string)
Gumroad listing description (under 150 words — this is SEO-visible copy)
Price: $49 fixed, reasoning for no pay-what-you-want
File upload checklist with exact filenames
Receipt email copy (the automated message sent on purchase — 100–150 words, sets expectations, drives them to START HERE first)
Affiliate program: yes or no, percentage recommendation, and one sentence of reasoning
One follow-up product concept (one sentence only — don't build it here)n the Scorecard immediately

Tone: warm but direct. Like a founder handing you something they genuinely find useful.
Task B — Quick Reference Card
Write outputs/quick_reference_card.md as a single-page cheat sheet. Extract the 10 highest-leverage actions from across the entire bundle. Format as:
markdown# The 10 Highest-Leverage Actions
## One page. Everything that moves the needle.

[Ranked 1–10 with a single sentence of explanation each. #1 should be taking the Scorecard.]
Task C — Landing Page Brief
Write outputs/landing_page_brief.md as a strategic brief a developer and copywriter would use to build the page. Structure:
Hero Section
Provide: primary headline, subheadline, the specific fear this addresses, and CTA button text. The headline must replace "Don't let months of coding die on Page 3." Constraints: no guarantee language, no "mathematically," no outcome promises. Lead with the diagnostic angle — this product tells you whether you specifically are ready.
The Reframe Section
Write the core argument for why this product is different from free PH guides. The Scorecard is the differentiator. Show how to present it: not as "a bonus tool" but as the entry point to the entire system.
Social Proof Specifications
Define exactly what proof would work for this audience. Specify: proof formats (launch metrics with actual numbers, before/after Scorecard scores, named founder quotes with product URLs), what to avoid (star ratings, generic testimonials, fabricated numbers), and a placeholder structure showing what real proof would look like once it exists.
Pricing Presentation
Answer three specific questions:

How do you justify $49 versus free Twitter threads? (Give the actual argument, not a framework for finding it)
What is the right "compare to" anchor? (Reject "a fancy dinner" — find the anchor that actually resonates with a technical founder)
Lead with $49 clean or show $29 crossed out? Provide a recommendation with reasoning.

FAQ Section
Write all 6 FAQs with full answers, not placeholders:

"I don't have an audience yet — will this still help?"
"Is this just another checklist?"
"What if I'm launching in 2 weeks, not 30 days?"
"How is this different from the free PH guides on Twitter?"
"What if I buy this and still don't hit Top 5?"
"Do I need to complete ever
