The PH Top 5 Playbook: A 30-Day Launch System for Indie Hackers
Welcome to the Playbook. This isn't a theory document; it's an execution engine. If you follow this timeline, complete the checklists, and use the swipe files, you will mathematically maximize your chances of hitting the Top 5 on Product Hunt and driving hundreds of highly qualified leads to your SaaS.
MODULE 1: The 30-Day Countdown Timeline
Don't launch tomorrow. Give yourself a 30-day runway to build momentum.
Days 30 to 15: Foundation
 * [ ] Finalize the Core Loop: Ensure your onboarding is frictionless. PH traffic bounces fast if they can't figure out the app in 30 seconds.
 * [ ] Create a "Launch Coming Soon" teaser: Add a banner to your current website.
 * [ ] Build a Launch List: Start collecting emails specifically for the launch (e.g., "Get 50% off when we launch on Product Hunt").
 * [ ] Identify a Hunter: Find someone who has hunted similar products in your niche. (Use the swipe file in Module 3). Note: Hunting yourself is fine now, but a top Hunter adds social proof.
Days 14 to 7: Asset Creation
 * [ ] Design the Thumbnail (240x240px): Must be a GIF. It needs to stand out. Use high contrast.
 * [ ] Design the Gallery (1270x760px): 3-5 images. The first image must explain the value proposition in under 5 words.
 * [ ] Record the Demo Video (Under 2 minutes): Keep it punchy. Show the "Aha!" moment in the first 15 seconds. Upload to YouTube.
 * [ ] Write the Tagline (Under 60 characters): Benefit-driven, not feature-driven.
 * [ ] Draft the Maker Comment: (Use the swipe file in Module 3).
Days 6 to 1: The Final Polish
 * [ ] Schedule the Launch: Schedule it for 12:01 AM Pacific Time (PST). This gives you the full 24 hours to collect upvotes.
 * [ ] Draft Launch Emails: Prepare your newsletter blast for Day 1.
 * [ ] Warm up your network: DM 20-30 friends/creators. Let them know you are launching on Tuesday (Tuesday/Wednesday are the highest traffic days, but hardest to rank. Thursday/Friday have lower traffic but easier competition).
MODULE 2: The Asset Optimization Checklist
Before you hit schedule, verify every asset against this checklist.
1. The Tagline (The most important copy)
 * [ ] Is it under 60 characters?
 * [ ] Does it state exactly what it does? (Bad: "Revolutionize your workflow". Good: "Automate your freelance tax calculations").
 * [ ] Does it exclude buzzwords? (Remove AI, Web3, Synergy unless absolutely critical).
2. The Thumbnail (The hook)
 * [ ] Is it an animated GIF? (Increases CTR by 20%+).
 * [ ] Is it legible when scaled down to 40x40 pixels?
 * [ ] Does it contrast well with a white background?
3. The Gallery (The pitch)
 * [ ] Image 1: The UI Hero Shot + Big Value Prop.
 * [ ] Image 2: The main feature/solution.
 * [ ] Image 3: Social proof or integrations.
 * [ ] Image 4: Pricing / Special PH Discount code.
