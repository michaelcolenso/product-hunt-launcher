# Activation Sequence Templates (Day 0, 1, 3, 7)

Use these templates after launch to move signups toward activation and paid conversion. Personalize role terms and examples before sending.

## Segment 1: Solo Founder

### Day 0 Email
Subject: Your first weekly report can be done in 5 minutes

Hi {{first_name}},

Thanks for signing up today.

Start here: connect one data source, run your first report, and share it with yourself. That sequence is the fastest route to first value.

Launch setup guide: {{setup_url}}

If you hit friction, reply with one screenshot and we will send a direct fix.

### Day 1 Email
Subject: One founder workflow that cuts weekly recap time

Hi {{first_name}},

Most solo founders use this pattern:
1. collect incidents for one week,
2. auto-generate a report,
3. export the summary into their planning doc.

If you complete step 2 today, you will have enough signal to decide whether this fits your workflow.

### Day 3 Email
Subject: Common blocker: too much setup at once

Hi {{first_name}},

If setup felt heavy, narrow scope to one team workflow and one output format. You can expand after first value.

Use this quick path: {{quick_path_url}}

### Day 7 Email
Subject: Decide: keep momentum or pause cleanly

Hi {{first_name}},

You now have enough usage data to decide if this stays in your stack.

If value is clear, convert now and keep your launch pricing: {{offer_link}}
If not, reply with what blocked you and we will map a fix plan.

### In-App Message (Day 0-1)
Finish one report today to unlock your highest-value workflow.

### In-App Message (Day 3-7)
You are one step from repeatable weekly reporting. Complete your next scheduled run now.

## Segment 2: Engineering Manager

### Day 0 Email
Subject: First-value path for your team lead workflow

Hi {{first_name}},

To evaluate quickly, use this order:
1. connect your incident source,
2. generate one team report,
3. invite one teammate for review.

This gives you a real signal on team usefulness within one session.

### Day 1 Email
Subject: Template used by managers for weekly incident review

Hi {{first_name}},

Teams get the best result when they standardize one review format across incidents. Here is the manager template we recommend: {{manager_template_url}}

### Day 3 Email
Subject: Reduce review drift with one report owner

Hi {{first_name}},

If adoption is uneven, assign one owner for report finalization and distribution. Ownership usually lifts consistency faster than more features.

### Day 7 Email
Subject: Convert with confidence or run a 7-day extension test

Hi {{first_name}},

If your team shipped at least one weekly report, convert now to preserve continuity: {{offer_link}}

If decision confidence is still low, reply and we will set a structured 7-day extension test with success criteria.

### In-App Message (Day 0-1)
Invite one teammate after your first report to validate real team fit.

### In-App Message (Day 3-7)
Assign report ownership now to increase weekly execution consistency.

## Segment 3: Product Ops / RevOps

### Day 0 Email
Subject: Validate reporting quality before your next sync

Hi {{first_name}},

Run one report and check three outputs: data completeness, action-item clarity, and stakeholder readability.

If those pass, this is ready for your next cross-functional sync.

### Day 1 Email
Subject: Ops checklist for reliable weekly reporting

Hi {{first_name}},

Use this QA checklist before sharing reports broadly: {{ops_checklist_url}}

### Day 3 Email
Subject: Improve adoption with role-specific report views

Hi {{first_name}},

If usage is flat, segment report views by role. Technical and non-technical stakeholders usually need different detail levels.

### Day 7 Email
Subject: Keep the launch workflow or archive it

Hi {{first_name}},

You have one week of data. If reporting quality and speed improved, convert here: {{offer_link}}

If not, send your top two blockers and we will recommend the next experiment.

### In-App Message (Day 0-1)
Check data completeness before sharing your first report externally.

### In-App Message (Day 3-7)
Role-specific views can improve stakeholder adoption this week.

## Operator Notes

- Keep one primary CTA per message.
- Tie every send to one measurable metric in `revenue_command_center.csv`.
- Pause sequence sends for users with open critical support tickets.
