# Start Here

You bought this because you do not want launch day to be a coin flip. That is the right reason. Most Product Hunt advice online tells you what to post, but not whether your current setup can support the result you want. This bundle is built to solve that gap: diagnose readiness first, then execute with precision.

You now have three core assets that work together:

1. `scorecard.md` is your diagnostic layer. It measures your launch readiness across the five categories that usually decide outcomes: Audience Infrastructure, Asset Quality, Network Activation, Timing & Positioning, and Retention Infrastructure.
2. `teardown.md` is your reality check. It shows what a full launch day looks like under pressure, including mistakes, recovery decisions, and numbers that matter after ranking.
3. `playbook_v3.1.md` is your operating manual. It translates weak score areas into concrete actions, checklists, timing blocks, and fallback protocols.

Use them in this order every time:

First, complete the Scorecard in one sitting. Do not overthink answers or try to "score well." Accuracy matters more than optimism.

Second, read the Teardown and compare it to your own likely launch conditions. Focus on decision patterns, especially where momentum stalled and what changed it.

Third, use the Playbook as a targeted reference. Go straight to the module tied to your lowest score category, assign owners, and put dates on tasks.

What this product will do:
- Give you a clear view of where your launch is exposed.
- Help you prioritize the highest-leverage fixes before launch day.
- Give you a repeatable operations system for launch-day execution.

What this product will not do:
- Replace product-market fit.
- Create audience trust overnight.
- Remove uncertainty from competitive launch days.

Set expectations correctly and this becomes very practical: you reduce preventable mistakes, improve launch-day quality, and increase the odds that attention turns into activation and revenue.

Recommended usage rhythm:
- T-minus 30 to 14 days: complete Scorecard and close top two gaps.
- T-minus 14 to 2 days: harden assets and activation plan.
- T-minus 1 day to launch close: run the hour-by-hour playbook and rescue protocols.
- Post-launch week: run retention sprint and debrief.

If you are launching in less than two weeks, still use the same order, but compress scope to your weakest category plus one adjacent category.

Open `scorecard.md` now, answer all 40 questions, and let your actual readiness set your next move.
