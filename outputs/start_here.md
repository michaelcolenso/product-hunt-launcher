# Start Here

You bought this because you want launch effort to become measurable revenue, not a one-day ranking spike. This bundle is built for that outcome: diagnose readiness, execute a focused launch window, then run a post-launch revenue sprint with concrete instrumentation.

## 30-Minute First-Value Flow

Complete these three steps in one sitting before you do anything else:

1. Run `scorecard.md` and record your overall score plus lowest category.
2. Open `revenue_command_center.csv` and fill your baseline metrics from the latest 7 days.
3. Open `playbook_v3.2.md` Module 5 and start the Day 0-Day 7 revenue sprint checklist.

If you finish those steps, you will have a working operating system instead of a loose reading list.

## Success Definition

Primary success is movement in activation and paid conversion for your launch cohort.

Use this hierarchy:
- Tier 1: `activation_rate` improves versus your pre-launch baseline.
- Tier 2: `paid_conversion_rate` improves for activated users.
- Tier 3: launch cohort revenue compounds over Days 7-30.
- Secondary: leaderboard placement and social visibility.

## What Is Included

1. `scorecard.md`
   - 40-question diagnostic with weighted launch-to-revenue interpretation.
2. `teardown.md`
   - composite launch case with decision rationale and Day 7/30 revenue follow-through.
3. `playbook_v3.2.md`
   - operating procedures for countdown, launch day, and post-launch revenue execution.
4. `quick_reference_card.md`
   - one-page highest-leverage actions.
5. `revenue_command_center.csv`
   - daily metrics tracker for sessions through revenue.
6. `launch_cohort_tracker.csv`
   - user-level lifecycle tracking for launch cohort progress.
7. `offer_experiment_backlog.csv`
   - controlled offer and messaging experiment register.
8. `activation_sequence_templates.md`
   - Day 0/1/3/7 email and in-app message templates by segment.
9. `evidence_register.md`
   - claim-to-evidence map with confidence labels.

## Recommended Usage Rhythm

- T-minus 30 to 14 days: run Scorecard and close the two largest risks.
- T-minus 14 to 1 day: harden assets, outreach, and launch-day operations.
- Day 0 to Day 7: execute Module 5 SOP and track outcomes daily.
- Day 8 to Day 30: iterate offers, fix drop-off points, and document channel ROI.

## Guardrails

What this product does:
- creates decision structure for launch and revenue follow-through
- helps you prioritize repair work by measured risk
- gives templates and trackers so execution starts immediately

What this product does not do:
- replace product-market fit
- remove competition variance on launch day
- promise ranking outcomes

Open `scorecard.md` now, then complete the 30-minute first-value flow before planning additional work.
