# Start Here

You made a smart purchase if your goal is clarity before launch, not more generic advice. Most Product Hunt resources tell you what worked for someone else. This system helps you determine what is weak in your own launch setup, then fix it in priority order. Use it as an operating sequence, not a document library.

This bundle has three core components that work together:

1. `scorecard.md` is the diagnostic layer. It measures readiness across the categories that usually decide whether launch traffic becomes activation and paid conversion. Its job is to tell you where your real risk is right now.
2. `teardown.md` is the interpretation layer. It shows how launch decisions and tradeoffs play out in practice, including what was missed, what was recovered, and what drove downstream results.
3. `playbook_v3.2.md` is the execution layer. It contains the SOPs, checklists, and templates you use to close the specific gaps the Scorecard exposes and the Teardown clarifies.

The relationship is simple: Scorecard identifies your priority, Teardown explains the pattern behind that priority, Playbook gives you the exact operating actions to execute.

Follow this sequence exactly:

1. Scorecard first. Complete `scorecard.md` in one sitting and write down your total score plus your two lowest categories.
2. Teardown second. Read `teardown.md` with your low-score categories in front of you and note where the same failure patterns appear.
3. Playbook third, as reference. Open `playbook_v3.2.md` and go directly to the modules that address your lowest categories; do not try to run every section at once.

Supporting files (`revenue_command_center.csv`, `launch_cohort_tracker.csv`, templates, and backlog sheets) are implementation tools. Use them only after the three-step sequence above, so your execution is tied to diagnosed risk instead of random activity.

If you are pressed for time, still complete the full sequence once. Skipping Teardown usually leads to misdiagnosed fixes, and starting in Playbook usually creates busywork without meaningful metric movement.

Set expectations correctly. This product will help you make better launch decisions, prioritize high-impact fixes, and run a more disciplined Day 0-30 operation. It will not create demand for a weak offer, replace customer research, or promise a Top 5 placement. Product quality, timing, market context, and competitive launches still matter.

If you use this as intended, you should finish today with a ranked risk list, a focused execution plan, and clear metrics to track. That is the win condition for Day 1.

Open `scorecard.md` now and complete it before you read anything else.
