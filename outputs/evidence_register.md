# Evidence Register

Use this register to keep claims bounded, source-linked, and confidence-rated.

| Claim | Evidence Basis | Confidence | Usage Guardrail |
|---|---|---|---|
| Early comment depth is correlated with stronger launch visibility durability. | Composite teardown patterns across 19 documented Top 5 launches plus playbook case reviews. | Medium | Frame as directional pattern, not deterministic outcome. |
| Personalized outreach tends to outperform broadcast asks for qualified launch engagement. | Repeated pattern in teardown logs and outreach retrospectives from documented launches. | Medium | Use "tends to" and pair with audience-size caveat. |
| Smaller niche communities can produce higher conversion quality than broad social channels. | Channel-level activation comparisons in documented launch analyses. | Medium | Do not claim absolute superiority; test by segment. |
| Fast onboarding issue response in Day 0-Day 2 reduces launch cohort revenue leakage. | Incident-response timelines and conversion trend recovery in composite cases. | Medium | Keep language conditional on response speed and issue severity. |
| Seven-day lifecycle follow-up improves activation consistency versus ad hoc follow-up. | Cohort comparisons from launches with structured Day 0/1/3/7 sequences. | Medium | Avoid specific percentage promises unless measured in your own data. |
| Tracking activation and paid conversion separately improves decision quality after launch day. | Common analytics post-mortems where traffic-only views hid conversion problems. | High | Present as measurement hygiene, not direct growth promise. |
| Offer experiments with explicit hypotheses reduce random pricing changes. | Experiment logs from founder launch operations and post-launch reviews. | Medium | Emphasize decision discipline over bounded expected lift. |
| A launch can rank well and still underperform on business outcomes. | Multiple teardown scenarios where ranking and revenue outcomes diverged. | High | Keep ranking as secondary success metric in positioning copy. |

## Confidence Labels

- `High`: repeated, stable pattern with low interpretation ambiguity.
- `Medium`: recurring pattern with meaningful variance by product, audience, or execution quality.
- `Low`: early signal; treat as hypothesis until validated in your own data.

## Claim Hygiene Checklist

- Each external-facing claim maps to an entry above.
- Copy uses bounded language (`can`, `often`, `tends`, `in documented launches`).
- Avoid absolute terms such as `always`, `never`, and `100%` in sales and product copy.
