# Gumroad Setup

## Product Name
PH Top 5 Launch Audit System

## Gumroad Listing Description (SEO-visible, under 150 words)
Stop treating Product Hunt like a one-day ranking event. This bundle gives you a launch-to-revenue operating system: a weighted readiness scorecard, a full launch teardown with real decision tradeoffs, and SOPs plus trackers to improve activation and paid conversion after launch day. You get a command center CSV, cohort tracker, Day 0/1/3/7 lifecycle templates, and an offer experiment backlog so execution starts immediately. Built for technical founders and small teams who want measurable post-launch outcomes, not generic launch tips.

## Price
$49 fixed

## Pricing Rationale (Single Product)
A fixed single-product price keeps the buying decision simple while signaling clear operational scope. The value is practical execution leverage: measurable diagnostics, runbooks, templates, and tracking assets that reduce revenue leakage during Days 0-30.

Subject: Your launch-to-revenue system is ready

Thanks for your purchase.

Start with `START HERE` first (`start_here.md`) before opening anything else. It gives the required order so you do not waste time: Scorecard first, Teardown second, Playbook third as reference. After that, use `revenue_command_center.csv` and `launch_cohort_tracker.csv` to set your baseline and track movement through activation and paid conversion.

This system is designed to improve decision quality and execution discipline across Day 0-30. It does not promise rank outcomes, but it will give you a concrete way to diagnose risk, prioritize fixes, and run launch follow-through with measurable checkpoints.

If you only do one thing today, complete the Scorecard from start to finish.
