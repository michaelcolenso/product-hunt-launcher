# Gumroad Setup

## Product Name
PH Top 5 Launch Audit System

## Gumroad Listing Description (SEO-visible, under 150 words)
Stop treating Product Hunt like a one-day ranking event. This bundle gives you a launch-to-revenue operating system: a weighted readiness scorecard, a full launch teardown with real decision tradeoffs, and SOPs plus trackers to improve activation and paid conversion after launch day. You get a command center CSV, cohort tracker, Day 0/1/3/7 lifecycle templates, and an offer experiment backlog so execution starts immediately. Built for technical founders and small teams who want measurable post-launch outcomes, not generic launch tips.

## Price
$49 fixed

## Pricing Rationale (Single Product)
A fixed single-product price keeps the buying decision simple while signaling clear operational scope. The value is practical execution leverage: measurable diagnostics, runbooks, templates, and tracking assets that reduce revenue leakage during Days 0-30.

Thanks for your purchase.

Start with `start_here.md` and complete the 30-minute first-value flow in this order:
1) run `scorecard.md`,
2) fill your baseline in `revenue_command_center.csv`,
3) start Module 5 in `playbook_v3.2.md`.
