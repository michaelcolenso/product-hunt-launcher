# Gumroad Setup

## Product Name
PH Top 5 Launch Audit System

## Gumroad Listing Description (SEO-visible, under 150 words)
Stop guessing whether your Product Hunt launch is ready. This bundle gives you a diagnostic-first system: a 40-question weighted scorecard, a full launch teardown with real decision tradeoffs, and an execution playbook mapped to your weakest readiness areas. Use it to identify your highest-risk gaps before launch day, run a tighter 24-hour launch operation, and improve conversion after the ranking window closes. Built for technical founders, indie hackers, and small product teams who want practical launch decisions instead of generic advice.

## Price
$49 fixed

## Pricing Rationale (No pay-what-you-want)
A fixed price signals a defined product with clear scope and avoids decision fatigue at checkout. Pay-what-you-want tends to push buyers toward impulse pricing and can undercut perceived rigor for a diagnostic product. The value here is the system and sequencing, so consistent pricing supports trust and positioning.

Thanks for your purchase.

Start with `start_here.md` first. It gives you the exact order to use everything and what to prioritize based on time.

Recommended sequence:
1) Run `scorecard.md` and identify your lowest category scores.
2) Read `teardown.md` to see how launch-day decisions play out in practice.
3) Use `playbook_v3.1.md` as your execution manual for the gaps you found.

If you are launching soon, focus on your weakest category plus one adjacent category before expanding scope.

This bundle is designed to reduce preventable launch mistakes and improve post-launch follow-through.
