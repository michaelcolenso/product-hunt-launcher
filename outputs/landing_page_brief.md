# Landing Page Brief

## Hero Section

**Primary headline**
Know if your Product Hunt launch is actually ready before you go live.

**Subheadline**
Start with a weighted readiness diagnostic that shows your highest-risk gaps, then use the teardown and playbook to fix them with a clear operating sequence.

**Specific fear this addresses**
Technical founders fear a launch that ranks decently but fails to convert into paid traction, leaving them with vanity metrics and no repeatable growth system.

**CTA button text**
Run the Revenue Readiness Scorecard

## The Reframe Section

Most launch guides end at visibility. This product starts there and continues through monetization.

Position the system as three linked layers:
1. `scorecard.md` diagnoses readiness and identifies the highest business-risk gap.
2. `playbook_v3.2.md` gives operational checklists and owner-based SOPs.
3. Implementation assets (`revenue_command_center.csv`, `launch_cohort_tracker.csv`, and lifecycle templates) convert advice into measurable execution.

The value is not more launch ideas. The value is fewer revenue leaks after launch day.

## Social Proof Specifications

**Proof formats to prioritize**
- Before/after activation_rate and paid_conversion_rate changes over 7 and 30 days.
- Cohort conversion outcomes by channel (not just total traffic).
- Founder quotes that mention concrete operational wins (for example, "we fixed onboarding drop-off within 6 hours").

**What to avoid**
- Generic "Top 5" screenshots without revenue context.
- Testimonials without role, product URL, or timeline.
- Absolute claims about outcomes.

**Proof block placeholder structure**
- Founder: Name, Role, Product URL
- Baseline: activation_rate and paid_conversion_rate before launch
- Actions Taken: 2-3 concrete SOP actions
- Outcome: Day 7 and Day 30 revenue metrics
- Founder Quote: one sentence on what changed operationally

## Pricing Presentation

**How to justify $49 versus free threads**
Free threads provide tactics. This product provides a decision and execution system with operating files: weighted diagnosis, runbooks, trackers, and message templates tied to measurable outcomes.

**Right "compare to" anchor**
Anchor against the cost of one launch that fails to activate or monetize traffic. Rebuilding momentum and fixing post-launch leakage typically costs more than this bundle.

**Lead with $49 or use crossed-out pricing?**
Lead with clean $49 pricing. Avoid crossed-out framing; operational products earn trust through clarity and specificity.

## FAQ Section

### 1. Will this still help if I care more about revenue than ranking?
Yes. Ranking is treated as secondary. The primary operating target is movement in activation and paid conversion over Days 0-30.

### 2. Is this just another checklist bundle?
No. It includes decision logic (weighted scorecard), SOPs with owners and SLAs, and execution assets that make outcomes measurable.

### 3. I launch in two weeks. Is that enough time?
Yes, if you prioritize. Run the scorecard, fill the command center baseline, then execute Module 5 rescue and conversion actions tied to your weakest category.

### 4. How is this different from free Product Hunt posts?
Free posts rarely provide an end-to-end operating system with cohort tracking, lifecycle templates, and revenue rescue protocols.

### 5. What if I do not finish Top 5?
This product does not promise ranking outcomes. It is designed to reduce preventable mistakes and improve activation and paid conversion from launch traffic.

### 6. Do I have to use every file?
No. Use the scorecard first, then deploy only the SOPs and templates tied to your biggest risk. Expand scope after those are stable.
