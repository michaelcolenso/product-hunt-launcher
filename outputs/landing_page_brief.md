# Landing Page Brief

## Hero Section

**Primary headline**
Know if your Product Hunt launch is ready before you spend the day pushing it.

**Subheadline**
A diagnostic-first launch system: score your readiness, study a full decision-log teardown, and execute with a practical playbook tied to your weakest gaps.

**Specific fear this addresses**
Technical founders worry they will launch after months of building, get brief attention, then discover too late that weak preparation blocked ranking and conversion.

**CTA button text**
Run the Readiness Scorecard

## The Reframe Section

Most free Product Hunt guides start with tactics. This product starts with diagnosis. That is the core difference.

Position the Scorecard as the front door, not a bonus: it determines whether the founder should launch now, delay, or run a focused repair sprint. The teardown then shows how those categories behave on a real launch day under pressure. The playbook is the execution reference that maps low scores to exact actions. The sequence is the value: diagnose, validate, execute.

## Social Proof Specifications

**Proof formats to prioritize**
- Launch metrics with real numbers and timeframe (ranking, upvotes, comments, activation, paid conversion)
- Before/after readiness scores from the same founder
- Named founder quotes with product URLs and role context

**What to avoid**
- Star ratings without context
- Generic testimonials like "great product"
- Fabricated or rounded vanity numbers with no source

**Proof block placeholder structure**
- Founder: Name, Role, Product URL
- Before Scorecard: overall score + weakest category
- Actions Taken: 2-3 concrete steps from playbook
- Launch Outcome: ranking + activation + 7-day conversion
- Founder Quote: one specific sentence about what changed

## Pricing Presentation

**How to justify $49 versus free Twitter threads**
Free threads give ideas. This bundle gives decision structure. The Scorecard tells founders what not to ignore, the teardown shows realistic execution under pressure, and the playbook provides operational checklists tied to actual gaps. The value is avoided missteps and faster prioritization, not information volume.

**Right "compare to" anchor**
Anchor against one failed launch cycle. For a technical founder, losing one launch day can mean weeks of delay, missed feedback loops, and wasted distribution effort. Compared with rebuilding momentum after a weak launch, $49 is a low-cost diagnostic and execution system.

**Lead with $49 or show $29 crossed out?**
Lead with clean $49 pricing. Crossed-out pricing can signal low trust for a diagnostic product targeting technical buyers. A straightforward fixed price communicates confidence and reduces decision friction.

## FAQ Section

### 1. I do not have an audience yet, will this still help?
Yes, and that is exactly why the Scorecard comes first. It will likely flag Audience Infrastructure as your primary gap, which prevents you from launching prematurely. Then you use the playbook to build measurable pre-launch support before picking a date. The bundle helps you avoid a weak launch, even if your immediate next move is to delay and strengthen distribution.

### 2. Is this just another checklist?
That concern is valid because many launch products are checklists with no decision logic. This bundle is different because the checklist items are tied to a weighted diagnostic model and validated through a full teardown narrative. You are not checking boxes blindly; you are prioritizing the exact failure points most likely to hurt your specific launch.

### 3. What if I am launching in 2 weeks, not 30 days?
You can still use it. Run the Scorecard immediately, then focus only on the lowest category and one adjacent category. Skip low-impact tasks and execute the highest-leverage repairs first: message clarity, first-hour engagement plan, and end-to-end funnel QA. The playbook supports compressed timelines when you prioritize based on measured risk instead of trying to do everything.

### 4. How is this different from the free Product Hunt guides on Twitter?
Free guides are useful for ideas, but they are rarely structured for your current readiness level. This bundle is built as a system: diagnose first, then execute the matching module. It also includes a transparent teardown with tradeoffs, mistakes, and operational details that short social posts usually skip. You get sequencing, not just tactics.

### 5. What if I buy this and still do not hit Top 5?
That is a fair question, and it is why the product sets expectations around execution quality, not promised ranking outcomes. A strong launch can still face heavy competition. The practical goal is to reduce preventable mistakes, improve conversion from launch traffic, and leave with clearer signals for the next iteration, whether or not ranking lands exactly where you wanted.

### 6. Do I need to complete everything or just the parts relevant to my score?
Start with the parts tied to your lowest score categories. That gives you the fastest improvement with limited time. After those are stable, complete the remaining modules to reduce edge-case risk. The system is designed for prioritization first and completeness second, so you can move quickly without ignoring critical weak points.
