# The 10 Highest-Leverage Actions
## One page. Everything that moves the needle.

1. Complete the Scorecard before locking a launch date so your plan is based on measured gaps, not assumptions.
2. Secure first-hour engagement commitments in writing from named supporters to avoid a flat opening window.
3. Run a five-second comprehension test on your tagline and first gallery image with target users.
4. Build a 24-hour activation schedule with owner handoffs so momentum does not collapse after the first spike.
5. Personalize outreach by segment and timezone instead of sending one generic blast.
6. Prepare a response bank for pricing, onboarding, integrations, and roadmap questions before launch day begins.
7. Monitor comment depth and reply speed as closely as upvotes, because discussion quality drives durable visibility.
8. Test signup, checkout, and launch offer code end-to-end within 48 hours of launch.
9. Trigger rescue protocols early when momentum stalls rather than waiting for ranking decline to worsen.
10. Run a seven-day post-launch retention sprint so launch traffic converts into activation and revenue.
